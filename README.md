# PURSUIT
### Project Details
Create a site that collects data from google, amazon, and Helium 10 on product/search trends. Make a unique page for a search term, condensing the information to be easy to read and infer from. The user will input a search term and the search term will be pushed into the sites to pull data on yearly trends, popularity by state, and where is it most popular. The user may then filter by the three sources if desired.

Provide data on profitability, competitors, etc., for user to determine if there is a market for the product
